# 2019-Spring-Robotics-Competition-Code

This is my UTSA Robotics competition code. 
Our team used this code to win first place in the competition. 
Please feel free to modify it and make it better. 

As is this code should be able to do the following:
1. Use Vuforia to determine where it is on the map.
2. Correct itself onto the proper place on the map based off the location it read. 
3. Use Tensorflow to search for the orange cube which is the goal in this competition. 
4. Plan a path around barriers to the cube. 
5. Execute that path. 
6. Place itself directly in the squares. 

This was done with the smaller robot option. 

Things I need to do... 
add additional comments to the code to make it more usuable for anyone else.
